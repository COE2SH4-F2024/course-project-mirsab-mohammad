LEAVING THIS HERE SO WE CAN MAKE SEPERATE NOTES FOR EACHOTHER WITHOUT BOMBARING OUR CODE WITH COMMENTS (LEAVE UPDATES FOR EACHOTHER HERE)

Gonna make my own little schedule that I'd like for us to follow but we ball, this issome stuff we need to do:

     Phase 1
    -Developer 1: Setting up game mechanisms: input system, game condition system, score system.
    -Developer 2: Implementing player object phase 1 â€“ FSM transplant from PPA3, single segment movement validation after OOD refactoring.

    I'll deal with implementing play object and stuff. I'll also move over all the PPA3 stuff today as well

    You should get all the game mechanisms up (IO, condition, score, etc.) SPEND SOME TIME READING THRU MANUAL | WATCHING VIDEO | UNDERSTANDING THE SKELETON CODE IT LOWKEY HELPS


    In general ITERATION 1A is done by me (all the ppa refactoring for the player class, flipped from dev roles ik...)  ---> I'll get the player moving around by porting the FSM into player class (player class still has some stuff to do not full implementation)

    and ITERATION 2A is done by you (you refactor all the game mechanisms from ppa3 and 2) ---> You'll get the board working (baord size, input parameters, exit and clean up routines (REALLY IMPORTANT TO FREE MEMORY DURING CLEANUP))

    Also this is different from last years project

 ===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================



    TIMELINE:   nov30th - iteration 1 (iteration 2 started as well at least a little) 
                EARLY dec 1st - iteration 2 (we should call at night and start iteration 3 at this point) ***IF WE COULD FINISH IT THAT'D BE GREAT?
                dec 2nd - finish everything up, if we have time we can work on bonus.


    ===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

    GOAL: iteration 1 finished BEFORE saturday night (Start iteration 2 during SAT night):
    Result: Basically just ppa2 working again lmao

    ||| LEAVE ANY UPDATES FOR THIS SECTION OF THE ITERATIONS UNDERNEATH HERE - MARK EM BY DATE/TIME AND ANY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER |||
    *keep git commits messages concise with file/progress, and more indepth explanation here (don't spend alot of time trying to explain it if someone is confsued as long as it works)



    Nov29th (2pm) - Iteration 0 COMPLETE (READ THIS)
    Look at objpos.h and .c     I just added the TODO section (making sure we follow rule of 4). Make sure you understand all the skeleton code b4 you code or else you'll be lost.
    Git Pull every time you work on the project too and look here first for any updates. ALWAYS GIT COMMIT AND PUSH even small changes.
    I also use an extension called Colorful Comments (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ParthR2031.colorful-comments). I use the ^ before the comment line to make my comments yellow so 
    you can download it too if u want or just ignore any signs you see infront of the comments that I've left. 

    also add your info to the README file.
